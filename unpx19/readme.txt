A successor to Paojian's th19oldspr patch. While that patch tried restorying boss sprites only, this patch strives to cover every pixel sprite: boss sprites, player sprites, and miscellaneous sprites. We also check for new sprites that fit in Touhou 19 every time a new game comes out.

Boss sprites found: Reimu, Marisa, Sanae, Ran, Aunn, Nazrin, Seiran, Orin, Tsukasa, Mamizou, Yachie, Saki, Suika, Yuuma (partial)
